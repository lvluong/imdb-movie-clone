# Victor's Homework

Stuff goes here.

## Here's how you use GitHub!

The first time you start:

* Click the little forky looking thing on the left (3rd icon)
* Click initialize repository
* Then add the files and a commit message like "Victor's first commit" and then click checkmark.
* Now, we go to GitHub! Press little plus button and new repository.
* Leave all default settings. You want an empty repository.
* Copy and paste the URL (should look like https://github.com/lvluong/imdb-movie-clone.git).
* Now hit: cmd shift p and type "open new terminal"
* in here, type the following: git remote add origin https://github.com/lvluong/imdb-movie-clone.git
  * replace that url with the new thing
* come back here, and now you can push!!
* hit "push to" and select the repository you just created, and enter your credentials.

The next time:

* You'll see files pop up on the left pane. The ones that you want to send up, hit the "+" button next to them (or you can plus them all via some other button which I think appears, which is common).
* Type a message explaining what it is.
* Hit the checkmark.
* Do the push to thing again.
